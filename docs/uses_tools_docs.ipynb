    "**1. What is SQLAlchemy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy is a **Python library** that provides a high-level interface for interacting with relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.\n",
    "It has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQLAlchemy Core** – A low-level abstraction that lets you build SQL queries programmatically.\n",
    "2. **SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper)** – Allows you to map Python classes to database tables, so you can interact with the database using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why SQLAlchemy is needed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases store and manage structured data, but writing **raw SQL** can be repetitive, error-prone, and hard to maintain. SQLAlchemy solves these problems by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstracting database operations** – You can write Python code, and SQLAlchemy translates it into SQL queries compatible with your database.\n",
    "* **Cross-database compatibility** – The same code can work with PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, etc., without changing SQL syntax.\n",
    "* **Safety** – Prevents SQL injection by handling query parameters securely.\n",
    "* **Efficiency** – Manages connections, transactions, and query execution efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How SQLAlchemy works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Engine** – The core interface to the database. It manages connections and executes SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    "   engine = create_engine(\"postgresql+psycopg://user:password@host:port/dbname\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Connection / Session** – You use a connection or session to interact with the database.\n",
    "3. **Tables / ORM models** – You define tables using SQLAlchemy Core or ORM classes.\n",
    "4. **Queries** – You can write queries either in SQLAlchemy’s expression language or using ORM methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why we use SQLAlchemy here (with PGVector / Supabase)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In your project, **PGVector** uses PostgreSQL as the backend and relies on SQLAlchemy for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Managing database connections** – PGVector needs to execute SQL commands to create tables, store vectors, and run similarity searches. SQLAlchemy handles this connection efficiently.\n",
    "* **Executing schema commands** – Creating the `pgvector` extension, adding documents, or running similarity search queries all require SQL execution.\n",
    "* **Driver compatibility** – PGVector specifically requires `psycopg3`, and SQLAlchemy ensures proper communication with PostgreSQL through this driver.\n",
    "* **Ease of integration** – By using SQLAlchemy, PGVector does not need you to manually write or manage raw SQL queries for vector storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Benefits in your case**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic connection handling** – You can switch between local PostgreSQL, Supabase, or other hosts easily.\n",
    "* **Automatic schema management** – SQLAlchemy allows PGVector to automatically create the required tables and extensions.\n",
    "* **Cross-database abstraction** – If you later change your database provider, minimal code changes are needed.\n",
    "* **Integration with Python objects** – Storing and retrieving vectors, metadata, and embeddings can be done cleanly with Python code.\n",
